        <h2>About Metal<sup>3</sup></h2>
        <p>
          Metal3 is an open-source project that provides a Kubernetes-native way
          of managing bare metal infrastructure. Its goal is to simplify the
          deployment and management of bare metal infrastructure in a
          cloud-native environment, while still leveraging the performance and
          control of bare metal. The project aims to provide users with the
          benefits of cloud-native infrastructure, such as automation,
          scalability, and flexibility, while still leveraging the performance
          and control of bare metal infrastructure. The project is part of the
          larger Metal stack, which also includes the MetalLB load balancer and
          the Cluster API (CAPI) infrastructure automation framework. Metal3
          aims to simplify the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters
          on bare-metal infrastructure, making it easier for developers and
          operators to take advantage of the benefits of containerization
          without the overhead of managing virtualization layers. <br />The
          Metal3 project leverages several existing technologies, such as the
          Redfish API, PXE boot, and IPMI, to enable the automated provisioning
          of bare-metal infrastructure. By integrating with the Kubernetes API,
          Metal3 can manage the entire lifecycle of bare-metal nodes, from
          initial discovery and provisioning to ongoing maintenance and updates.
          One of the key features of Metal3 is the ability to deploy Kubernetes
          clusters without the need for specialized hardware or infrastructure.
          This allows organizations to leverage existing hardware assets, such
          as unused servers or desktop machines, to create Kubernetes clusters
          for development, testing, or production environments. Metal3 also
          provides a flexible and extensible architecture, allowing users to
          customize and extend the platform to meet their specific needs. The
          project is actively maintained by a community of developers and
          contributors, and has been adopted by several large organizations,
          including Intel, Red Hat, and Google.

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The mission of the Metal3 project is to enable users to manage bare
          metal infrastructure in a cloud-native way, with the same level of
          flexibility, scalability, and automation as virtual machines in a
          cloud environment. With the rise of containerization and the
          popularity of Kubernetes, there has been a growing need for a solution
          that can manage bare metal infrastructure in a similar manner. The
          Metal3 project aims to bridge this gap by providing a declarative,
          Kubernetes-native API for managing bare metal servers. One of the key
          objectives of the Metal3 project is to provide an interoperable,
          vendor-neutral API that can work with a wide range of hardware vendors
          and configurations. This allows users to avoid vendor lock-in and
          switch between hardware vendors as needed, without having to change
          their infrastructure management solution. The Metal3 project also aims
          to provide a secure and reliable infrastructure management solution
          for bare metal servers. This includes features such as power
          management, monitoring, and fault tolerance, as well as secure boot
          and firmware updates. The project places a strong emphasis on security
          and compliance, and strives to provide a solution that meets the needs
          of enterprise users.

        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p>
          <strong
            >The Metal3 project is composed of several key components,
            including:</strong
          >
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Bare Metal Operator:</strong> This component is responsible
            for managing the lifecycle of bare metal servers, including
            provisioning, power management, and monitoring. It provides a
            declarative, Kubernetes-native API for managing bare metal
            infrastructure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cluster API Provider Metal3:</strong> This component is a
            Kubernetes Cluster API provider that allows users to provision and
            manage bare metal clusters using Kubernetes API primitives. It
            allows users to manage bare metal clusters in the same way they
            would manage virtual clusters in a cloud environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Metal3-io/ironic:</strong> This component is an OpenStack
            project that provides a RESTful API for managing bare metal servers.
            It allows users to provision and manage bare metal servers using a
            RESTful API, and integrates with the Bare Metal Operator to provide
            a Kubernetes-native API for managing bare metal infrastructure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Metal3-io/ipa-operator:</strong> This component is
            responsible for managing the Ironic Python Agent (IPA), which is
            used for deploying operating systems onto bare metal servers. It
            provides a declarative, Kubernetes-native API for managing the IPA
            and the deployment of operating systems onto bare metal servers.

            users can manage large fleets of bare metal servers with ease,
            ensuring that they are configured correctly, running the right
            firmware and drivers, and are being monitored for any issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Simplifying the management of Hardware Lifecycle:</strong>
            Metal3 simplifies the hardware lifecycle management, from
            provisioning to retirement, with features like firmware management,
            IPMI management, inventory management, and power management.

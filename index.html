          Description of Metal3: An Open-Source Solution for Kubernetes-Native
          Management of Bare Metal Infrastructure.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Metal3 is an open-source project that simplifies the deployment and
          management of bare metal infrastructure in a cloud-native environment.
          Its goal is to provide users with the benefits of cloud-native
          infrastructure while leveraging the performance and control of bare
          metal infrastructure. Metal3 is part of the larger Metal stack, which
          includes MetalLB and the Cluster API. The project leverages Redfish
          API, PXE boot, and IPMI technologies to enable the automated
          provisioning of bare-metal infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the key features of Metal3 is the ability to deploy Kubernetes
          clusters without specialized hardware or infrastructure. Organizations
          can leverage existing hardware assets, such as unused servers or
          desktop machines, to create Kubernetes clusters for development,
          testing, or production environments. Metal3 provides a flexible and
          extensible architecture, allowing users to customize and extend the
          platform to meet their specific needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Metal3 project's mission is to provide users with the ability to
          manage bare metal infrastructure in a cloud-native way, with the same
          level of flexibility, scalability, and automation as virtual machines
          in a cloud environment. With the growing need for a solution that can
          manage bare metal infrastructure similarly to virtual machines, the
          Metal3 project bridges this gap by providing a declarative,
          Kubernetes-native API for managing bare metal servers. The project
          aims to provide an interoperable, vendor-neutral API that can work
          with a wide range of hardware vendors and configurations to avoid
          vendor lock-in and switch between hardware vendors as needed without
          changing the infrastructure management solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Metal3 project is composed of several key components, including
          the Bare Metal Operator, the Cluster API Provider Metal3,
          Metal3-io/ironic, and Metal3-io/ipa-operator. The Bare Metal Operator
          manages the lifecycle of bare metal servers, while the Cluster API
          Provider Metal3 allows users to provision and manage bare metal
          clusters using Kubernetes API primitives. Metal3-io/ironic provides a
          RESTful API for managing bare metal servers, while
          Metal3-io/ipa-operator manages the Ironic Python Agent used for
          deploying operating systems onto bare metal servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Metal3 project's goals include provisioning and managing bare
          metal infrastructure using declarative Kubernetes APIs, automating the
          deployment of Kubernetes clusters on bare metal, enabling hardware
          management at scale, simplifying the management of hardware lifecycle,
          and encouraging interoperability and standardization. Metal3 supports
          open standards like the Redfish API and the Common Information Model
          (CIM), promoting interoperability and standardization in bare metal
          infrastructure management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, Metal3 simplifies the deployment and management of bare metal
          infrastructure in a cloud-native environment, allowing users to
          leverage the performance and control of bare metal while still
          enjoying the benefits of cloud-native infrastructure. The project is
          actively maintained by a community of developers and contributors and
          has been adopted by several large organizations. With Metal3, users
          can manage bare metal infrastructure with the same level of
          flexibility, scalability, and automation as virtual machines in a
          cloud environment, enabling organizations to achieve their goals more
          efficiently and effectively.
